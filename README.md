# BART Real-Time Tracker

A modern, fully **data-driven** React.js application that uses the **BART Legacy API** to display real-time Bay Area Rapid Transit information â€” including live departure times, route information, and station details.

ðŸ”— **Live Demo**: [BART](https://realtime.jrgee.com)

## Overview

This app is designed for BART commuters and transit enthusiasts who want fast, reliable, and clean access to system data from any device. It leverages modern front-end tools to present legacy transit data in a real-time, user-friendly experience.

The project is bundled with **Webpack 5** and uses **Webpack Module Federation** to expose key components for use in other applications. This enables true micro-frontend architecture and remote composition.
